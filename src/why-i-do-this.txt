For myself
- I want my life to have meaning
- I want to be an expert in my field
- I want to feel satisfied knowing that I did everything that I possibly could
- When hearing some professors speak, I'm really impressed at their level of understanding. I want to achieve that too.
- Goal for 2017 is to get to $200,000/year
  + This looks like it's changing already
- You have 2 years to decide what the rest of your life is going to be like. I'm hoping to pursue one of these three:
  + Get a PhD and become a professor. 
     -- Depends heavily on CSS Software and/or FCWT success.
  + Become a software architect. 
     -- You have 2 years to learn as much about software/hardware as you can.
  + Get a linguistics degree. Become a linguist. Not sure exactly on the details, but to start off, learn German.
     -- Learn a new language every 6 months (I know, very ambitious).

For Harrison
- I want him to be proud of me
- I want him to have a solid foundation and a role-model to look up to
- I want him to have a great education (private school)

For Amira
- I want her to have a relaxed life
- I want her to be proud of her husband

For my Parents
- The same way I love Harrison and wish the best for him, I know my parents want the same for me
- I want my parents to be proud

My Goals
- Spend as much time with Harrison as possible
- Read at minimum 50 books in my field
- Get high A's in classes
- Read your books daily. Forget about stressing over the news (If reading news, read the computer-related news).
- Have a successful business/businesses (I know that this is achievable since I'm constantly observing the idiots that are running mega-businesses).
  + This is also crucial if I want to continue on with my PhD.
- Continue cycling (For my health. So that I have energy to keep up with Harrison. And you also enjoy it).
- Become more active with family (This is in works with Dado. It just needs to stop raining so that we can begin our ventures and then include our families).
- Stop being stupid, get your bank account to $100,000 in savings
